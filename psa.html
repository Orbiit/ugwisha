<h3>Final updates, probably</h3>
<ul class="open-sans">
  <li>
    Updated Ugwisha with the new schedule and support for some alternate
    schedules.

</ul>
<hr>
<p class="open-sans">
  I don't think Ugwisha will be updated much anymore this year. Ugwisha won't be
  able to display alternate schedules because it seems the school no longer uses
  their Google Calendar for alternate schedules. You'll have to switch back to
  <a

    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
  >UGWA</a> if you want updated features.
</p>
<p class="open-sans">
  If you're able to, you can update Ugwisha yourself by <a
    href="https://github.com/Orbiit/ugwisha"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
  >forking Ugwisha on Github</a>. However, it might be more interesting if you
  made your own Gunn schedule app since UGWA, too, will graduate by the end of
  this year, and I can advertise people to use your new app for the following
  year.
